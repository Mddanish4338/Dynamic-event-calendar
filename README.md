# Dynamic Event Calendar

## Project Overview

The **Dynamic Event Calendar** is a web application built with **React.js** that allows users to manage and organize their events in an interactive calendar. The application allows users to view, add, edit, and delete events for specific days in a visually appealing calendar grid. The calendar is fully dynamic, and it provides easy navigation through months and years. The events are stored locally, ensuring that data persists even after the page reloads. 

This project helps users keep track of their important events, appointments, and reminders, offering a clean and intuitive interface.

## Features

- **Interactive Calendar Grid**: View days of the month as clickable grid items, where users can interact with each day to manage events.
- **Add/Edit/Delete Events**: Users can add new events, edit existing ones, or delete events on specific dates.
- **Month and Year Navigation**: Use the "Next" and "Previous" buttons to navigate between months, while the calendar automatically adjusts to display the correct number of days.
- **Event Details**: Events are stored with essential details such as name, start time, end time, and description.
- **Persistent Event Storage**: Events are saved in the browserâ€™s local storage to ensure they persist across page reloads.
- **Responsive Design**: The calendar interface is fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and devices (desktop and mobile).

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: For building the user interface, managing state, and handling component interactions.
- **CSS**: To style the application and ensure it is responsive across all devices.
- **Local Storage**: For persistent storage of events, so data is not lost upon refreshing the page.
